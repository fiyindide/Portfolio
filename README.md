# About Me
I have experience in all testing phases as an agile software tester. I can use tools to create test plans and execute test cases for both web and mobile applications. Skilled in test automation, using the Selenium and testNG frameworks, reporting, API testing, performance testing, database testing, and defect investigation. 
I have a knack for picking up on business procedures quickly, and I'm effective at interacting with both users and developers.

As a proud Software Test Evangelist, I also like professional advancement advising, especially for recent graduates.
